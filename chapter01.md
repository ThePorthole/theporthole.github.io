You all have traveled to a camp on the edge of the Anauroch, at the foot of the Graycloak hills, set up by a group of travelers who are readying a caravan to venture into the desert.<br><br> The camp consists of tents of various sizes set up mainly by moon elves. The camp has been up for about a tenday and it has been growing as people have gathered to prepare the caravan into the Anauroch. In that time a large tent has been set up to serve as a tavern with drinks, food, and music. Other tents have been setup as makeshift shops for a variety of merchants. You realize if you ask around you can likely find any sort of standard gear you may need, as well as likely specialized things for the desert environment.<br><br>Myssa happens to be an acquaintance of Akai, as she recognizes the name, though she does not know much about the man. |
