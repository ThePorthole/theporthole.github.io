The pace is  faster than you would normally travel, but you are busy people with places to be and things to do. After about four hours, and as the sun begins to set, Belln turns to you |

As she sits playin her flute, she hears something wafting over the desert dunes.... it sounds like... singing. | 
| ![Myssa](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/464655068793143296/ed988706a44080d0e031664f672851a6.webp?size=128)<br>Myssa | **Myssa stops playing her flute and listens intently** |

| ![Myssa](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/464655068793143296/ed988706a44080d0e031664f672851a6.webp?size=128)<br>Myssa | **Myssa stays quiet and focuses her attention in the direction of the noise** | 
| ![Procrustes](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/464655070156423168/787ab4f674b7eca0a232c82497ccfa25.webp?size=128)<br>Procrustes | It's hauntingly beautiful and otherworldly in its nature. You figure you could follow the trail of it if you ventured into the desert | 
| ![Myssa](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/464655068793143296/ed988706a44080d0e031664f672851a6.webp?size=128)<br>Myssa | **Myssa whispers to Belln, and the others if they're awake as well** "Do you hear that singing?  Have you ever heard anything like that before?" | 
| ![Belln](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/464655070156423168/b194ca954bca2f1bf71d5537a6c8803e.webp?size=128)<br>Belln | *she wakes up to the sound of her name* "It's the call of the desert. Just don't follow it, whatever you do." | 
| ![Myssa](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/464655068793143296/ed988706a44080d0e031664f672851a6.webp?size=128)<br>Myssa | "The call of the desert? What in the world.  Ok, good to know - I'll keep that in mind!" | 
| ![Myssa](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/464655068793143296/ed988706a44080d0e031664f672851a6.webp?size=128)<br>Myssa | **Myssa isn't too concerned by what Belln said, so she keeps playing her pan flute, just a little more quietly than before** | 
| ![Procrustes](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/464655070156423168/787ab4f674b7eca0a232c82497ccfa25.webp?size=128)<br>Procrustes | As the shift changes over, Smokey takes over the watch | 
| ![Procrustes](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/464655070156423168/787ab4f674b7eca0a232c82497ccfa25.webp?size=128)<br>Procrustes | After a short while, he begins to hear singing coming from the desert. | 
| ![Smokey River](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/464655068793143296/d377dfcfbdeaf56847dea1d0f7345bf3.webp?size=128)<br>Smokey River | **Smokey takes a short walk towards the singing to see what it is all about** | 
| ![Procrustes](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/464655070156423168/787ab4f674b7eca0a232c82497ccfa25.webp?size=128)<br>Procrustes | Smokey finds himself wandering the desert in the middle of the night, and the song of the desert overwhelms his senses, even had he wished to stop he would be unable... he continues walking further into the desert and eventually spies a gnarled looking tree standing up as if a beacon in the otherwise desolate landscape filled with sand and more sand. He can tell the singing is originating from this tree, but he is still a good 200 feet away from it at the moment. |

He has such a headache.  A small and wet red dot appears on the ground.  Then, another.  He instinctively wipes his nose and realizes that he smells blood.  His blood.  Staggering to the wall of the cave, M'ggah steadies himself and slowly the pain fades.**<br><br>_yeah.  fuck thinking._<br><br>`use tinderbox to light torch`<br>`throw torch at rage herb plant` |

AND THEN EXPLODES, sending M'ggah flying through the air toward the front of the cave, where he crashes into Smokey who had crashed into Belln |
