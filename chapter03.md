We nearly killed one another going after that stuff!" |

If you are going back on our deal, that is fine, no skin off my back, but the gods shall curse you for being disingenuous." |

While it may have been dangerous, I am paying you for the rage herb, not for the quest. Anything above what you have asked, which I must say, is a price you've already renegotiated for more than I initially offered, is simply not worth the hassle. I won't make anything on the deal." |

What we went through was worth double what was agreed upon at the start.  We won't be handing this nasty herb over without a bump in the price; otherwise you can hire someone else out.  I'm sure Smokey here would treat you real nicely if he grabbed some of that herb right now." |

Let's just find someone else if he's gonna be such a smurf about it.  It's gotta be worth a lot and he didn't even tell us why he wanted it because he's probably just gonna flip it so let's hit up his buyer instead.  Cut the middleman."<br><br>**Since storming back, M'ggah had been fighting a losing battle with his trousers and so most of his little speech was spent wrenching his belt around, with half his gear rattling to the ground midway through.  It was almost an intimidating moment when he kicked his knockoff katana up to his hand just before saying "Cut the middleman", but of course that was lost on M'ggah and the effect completely dispelled when he unleashed one of his patented simultaneous belchfarts while bending over to gather the rest of his gear.** |

There have been postings in various cities around the edge of the Anauroch desert calling for a team of well armed escorts to help a moon elf named Akai travel safely to an unknown destination in the desert. We all have traveled to this camp on the edge of the Anauroch, at the foot of the Graycloak hills, set up by a group of travelers who are readying a caravan to venture into the desert." |
