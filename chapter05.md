# Chapter 5 -- Into the Sandstorm

The sand stings your exposed skin and yet you push on quickly, trying to move as fast as possible through the moving dunes. Belln guides you out ahead, and after 5 hours of grueling travel she stops and turns back to the party |

Though, it could be a mirage. What do you think we should do Tia?" |

The oases are magical places and are not always in the same location, as the dunes do tend to shift out here in the open  desert. Its tough to be certain, and I am just accompanying you all on this mission - i cant make all the decisions for you." |

After a few hours of travel, the storm begins to pick up. Belln looks worried. |

There could very well be a cave or something similiar where we could take refuge for a few hours." |

You all rush into a cave and settle down. | 
| ![Belln](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/464655070156423168/b194ca954bca2f1bf71d5537a6c8803e.webp?size=128)<br>Belln | "Thank the gods this place is here..." |

| ![M'ggah](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/464655070156423168/967268da65916ba7391fc87d31341ab1.webp?size=128)<br>M'ggah | _maybe stormy is the leader i've been looking for?_ |

| ![Procrustes](https://cdn.discordapp.com/avatars/464655070156423168/787ab4f674b7eca0a232c82497ccfa25.webp?size=128)<br>Procrustes | As you sneak toward the light looking for hazards you run into something solid. Seems while you were scanning the ground for hazards you didn't take the time to scan in front of you for Druids. A beefy looking one looks down upon you as you lift your head to examine him |

Within the lair are a number of animals - there is a hungry wolf, a disloyal raven, a vain amur leopard, a bobcat, a photosensitive bat, and a greedy pixie all gathered around the edges of a shallow lake in the middle of the lair. The lake has about a foot of water in it and a small island in the middle with a protruding rock. Hovering above the rock near the ceiling is a bright glowing star that gives light to the lair. A small alcove serves as the druid's kitchen and bedroom and a number of trees grow on the edges of the cavern. |
