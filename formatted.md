The sands of the desert shift in moving dunes, and someone unaccustomed to the terrain would very easily become lost. The terrain itself is difficult and as such it takes you about 12 hours to arrive at the first oasis. <br><br>The oasis is a small body of water surrounded by a very lush assortment of fauna. You notice as you approach that Akai and his siblings have made it safely to the oasis and are waiting for you there. As you enter the oasis, you feel a protective wave come over you, and you notice the oasis is most likely magical in some way. |

Within the lair are a number of animals - there is a hungry wolf, a disloyal raven, a vain amur leopard, a bobcat, a photosensitive bat, and a greedy pixie all gathered around the edges of a shallow lake in the middle of the lair. The lake has about a foot of water in it and a small island in the middle with a protruding rock. Hovering above the rock near the ceiling is a bright glowing star that gives light to the lair. A small alcove serves as the druid's kitchen and bedroom and a number of trees grow on the edges of the cavern. |
