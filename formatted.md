The sands of the desert shift in moving dunes, and someone unaccustomed to the terrain would very easily become lost. The terrain itself is difficult and as such it takes you about 12 hours to arrive at the first oasis. <br><br>The oasis is a small body of water surrounded by a very lush assortment of fauna. You notice as you approach that Akai and his siblings have made it safely to the oasis and are waiting for you there. As you enter the oasis, you feel a protective wave come over you, and you notice the oasis is most likely magical in some way. |

Akai himself is happy though, and greets you kindly. |

I was hoping you would make it before we set forth in the morning, but you are here at last. We can move forward to the next oasis at daybreak!" |

As he passes Akai, he tries for a high-five.  Receiving a confused expression in return, M'ggah tries again.  This time, the response is a weak little raised wave, an awkward imitation of a proffered high-five by someone who has apparently never seen one before.  Chasing down Akai's hand in the air and settling for a weird sort of ham-fisted handshake, M'ggah grunts twice before moving on, shaking his head as he goes.**<br><br>_fkn elfs.  like trying to frathug a scaredy camel._ |

He notices out in the middle of the body of water is... an aarakocra sitting with his legs crossed on a small rock that juts just barely out of the water. |

I have been and shall always be the protector of the oasis, ever since I was given this rod." He spins a very ornately decorated rod in his hands. "Each oasis has a caretaker, and each oasis' caretaker will not put up with trouble within their oasis. Any attacks and fighting or threats are taken harshly. If a party is involved they will be warned. If there's a continued aggression or a second incident, the party will be magically banned from all the oases, making it impossible for them to find any of the oases in the desert, which may lead to their eventual death out there in the hot desert environment.<br>The water in here is always fresh and pure, even when others may attempt to poison or foul it and There's always an abundance of various fruits and meat available to gather and hunt in the oasis.<br><br>With that said, the desert becomes more and more dangerous the further in you get, and travel between the oases is never guaranteed." |

She is no caretaker. They call themselves Keepers, swooping down from the sky and feasting on travelers during their times between the 9 oases." |

Seems while you were scanning the ground for hazards you didn't take the time to scan in front of you for Druids. A beefy looking one looks down upon you as you lift your head to examine him |

Within the lair are a number of animals - there is a hungry wolf, a disloyal raven, a vain amur leopard, a bobcat, a photosensitive bat, and a greedy pixie all gathered around the edges of a shallow lake in the middle of the lair. The lake has about a foot of water in it and a small island in the middle with a protruding rock. Hovering above the rock near the ceiling is a bright glowing star that gives light to the lair. A small alcove serves as the druid's kitchen and bedroom and a number of trees grow on the edges of the cavern. |
