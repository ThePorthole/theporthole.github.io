You all have traveled to a camp on the edge of the Anauroch, at the foot of the Graycloak hills, set up by a group of travelers who are readying a caravan to venture into the desert.<br><br> The camp consists of tents of various sizes set up mainly by moon elves. The camp has been up for about a tenday and it has been growing as people have gathered to prepare the caravan into the Anauroch. In that time a large tent has been set up to serve as a tavern with drinks, food, and music. Other tents have been setup as makeshift shops for a variety of merchants. You realize if you ask around you can likely find any sort of standard gear you may need, as well as likely specialized things for the desert environment.<br><br>Myssa happens to be an acquaintance of Akai, as she recognizes the name, though she does not know much about the man. |

Easy peasy. Not a moment after she stuffed a handful into her bag did she feel this weird feeling rushing through her. She couldn't understand her own actions, but she was so angry that she simply swung her rapier at the nearest dryad she could see!  The strike landed right in its shoulder and made the dryad recoil in pain.** |

It?  Him?  _Her?_  It's tough to tell with these twigs, it's not like they're even really humanoid.  Subhumanoids.  Basically plants.  That one was the wife, right?  Let's just end this early.  Again: _subhumanoids_.  Nothing is cruel.  It's like harvest time down on the stick farm.<br><br>Racing towards Cunthammer and sweeping it up without breaking stride, M'ggah closes on Tark's wife and thunders her with a savage blow.  She staggers half-dead as M'ggah yells something incomprehensible about having hammered Tark's cunt.  Even if Tark could translate the snarling gibberish flung his way, who knows what his reaction would have been.  Unsurprisingly for M'ggah, he had attacked the wrong dryad altogether!** |

The sands of the desert shift in moving dunes, and someone unaccustomed to the terrain would very easily become lost. The terrain itself is difficult and as such it takes you about 12 hours to arrive at the first oasis. <br><br>The oasis is a small body of water surrounded by a very lush assortment of fauna. You notice as you approach that Akai and his siblings have made it safely to the oasis and are waiting for you there. As you enter the oasis, you feel a protective wave come over you, and you notice the oasis is most likely magical in some way. |

Leave your metal items here and you'll be able to retrieve them when you head out again." |

Within the lair are a number of animals - there is a hungry wolf, a disloyal raven, a vain amur leopard, a bobcat, a photosensitive bat, and a greedy pixie all gathered around the edges of a shallow lake in the middle of the lair. The lake has about a foot of water in it and a small island in the middle with a protruding rock. Hovering above the rock near the ceiling is a bright glowing star that gives light to the lair. A small alcove serves as the druid's kitchen and bedroom and a number of trees grow on the edges of the cavern. |
